I have completed first JavaScript Practical using HTML, CSS, Javascript. 

For all the mathematical operation I used Javascript math function such as Trigonometery. 

I use JavaScript to disable or unable a button. 

I also use JavaScript for dropdown menu, and change various other style like change the background color of button when click on that button(2nd, hyp) so that user will not confuse which option he/she ha choosed. And if we again click on the same button it change to its normal state. 

And by performing all the above action, I can conclude that I performed the DOM Manipulation.
